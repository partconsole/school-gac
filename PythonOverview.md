# School GAC Projects
Python projects 

Overview:
Learn to develop algorithms, utilizing common programming structures such as variables, functions, 
loops, control flow, basic data structures, classes, and a brief introduction to object-oriented programming.

Objectives:
• Develop a precise specification of an algorithmic means of addressing a domain use case.
• Develop working software that satisfies a precise specification appropriately using standard programming paradigms such as imperative, object-oriented, and functional.
• Work and communicate effectively in pairs or teams.
• Identify real world impacts and/or ethical concerns relating to applications of computing and communicate these effectively, both to those in the discipline and to those not
familiar with the discipline.

Quantitative Learnings:
• Critique quantitative or logical assertions using mathematical, logical, statistical, and/or algorithmic reasoning.
• Use mathematical, logical, statistical, and/or algorithmic analysis to make decisions and/or solve problems, 
including thorough examination of assumptions and utilization of proper methods.
• Articulate the substance and meaning of a critical mathematical, logical, statistical, and/or algorithmic analysis 
of a complex problem, including assumptions, methods, limitations, broader impacts, and conclusions.
